Program start

// Menu loop
Loop 

//Increases difficulty the lower it is
set variable difficulty to 
set variable amount of sides to 3
set variable max sides to

Determine distance between ball and player characters
Determine which player character is closest to the ball

// Game loop
Loop until escape key is pressed or 2 players are hit:
    // When 
    If seconds elapsed modulo difficulty equals 0 and amount of sides is less than max sides then:
        Increment amount of sides
        
        //Decrementing this variable increases the difficulty as opposed to lowering it
        //TODO: make this a little more intuitive
        Decrement difficulty variable
    
    //Gravity loop
    Loop until ball hits segment or reaches centerpoint of player character:
        If any player presses clockwise rotation key then rotate said player character clockwise
        If any player presses counter clockwise rotation key then rotate said player character counter clockwise
        Draw players with amount of sides
        Move ball towards nearest player in the form of gravity
        Draw ball
    
    If ball hits player segment and owner of segment is rotating clockwise then:
        set nearest player to the nearest player above the player
    else if ball hits player segment and owner of segment is rotating counter clockwise then:
        set nearest player to the nearest player below the player
    else:
        destroy player character that was hit
    
//Pausing
If escape key is pressed then:
    Display pause menu
    Do nothing until escape key is pressed
    Return to Game loop

If 2 players are hit then:
    Display game over screen
