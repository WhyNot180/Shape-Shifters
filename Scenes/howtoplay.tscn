text = "To begin a game, first you must be connected to the same network as the players you will be playing with. Then, you must either choose to
host the game, or join an existing one. If you choose to host a game, then you must enter in the maximum amount of players, the port number
(REMEMBER THIS NUMBER), and click \"Create Server\". If you wish to join an existing game, then you must enter in the IP address of the player
hosting (displayed at the bottom of their screen) and the port number they entered in earlier. If the connection is taking too long, then the
port may not be open on your network and the player hosting will have to choose a different port.

Once the game has begun, you will notice a ball, which will hurtle towards you and the other players. Once it hits you, it will bounce off and
some of your shapes will disappear. The ball will also stop being attracted towards you. If the ball reaches the inside of your shape, then your
shape will disappear and you may choose to spectate or quit to the menu. The game is over once all shapes have disappeared.


Controls:

Quit to menu: \"ESC\"
Move up: \"w\"
Move left: \"a\"
Move down: \"s\"
Move right: \"d\"
Rotate clockwise: \"e\"
Rotate counter-clockwise: \"q\""
